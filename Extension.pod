=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module extends HTML::Template to easily support methods and tags not
implemented in parent module. Piece of code needed to add new tags syntax and
new functionality are called plugins. All plugins can be dynamically loaded
for supporing needed syntax and functionality.
This module is a derivated class of HTML::Template base module and, like so,
works exactly ad HTML::Template do.
But, relative to original module, it differ from:

=over 4

=item * vanguard_compatibility_mode is enabled by default.

I like TMPL_* tags
but there is scope where %...% costruct is very usefull for readability;

=item * die_on_bad_params is disabled by default.

I don't like errors is i wish not to set params or if i try to set some 
unexistent parameters;

=item * "output" method is oveloaded

to support an hash item "as" to set params
directly without setting them  befor using param method;

=item * added a new method "html"

with two arguments, an hash ref for setting
parameters directly and a scalar argument to set here the file name of template
to use. If file name is the same of one just setting in, cache is used;

=item * a costructor parameter "plugins" is added

relative to an array ref with all plugins module to load;

=item * a "plugin_add" method was implemented

to add a single plugin to those already loaded

=item * a "plugins_clear" method was added

to unload all plugins

=item * added "filename","scalarref","arrayref","filehandle"

methods to modify template text after class initialization.

=back

All dynamic plugins live in the HTML::Template::Extension namespace and you can
built your own extension to support you prefered tags and functionality.
A plugin named DO_NOTHING is present in this package and can be use like a
skeleton to built your own plugin.
DO_NOTHING, as name says, add nothing to standard HTML::Template::Extension but
there are other plugins just available:

=over 4

=item * HTML::Template::Extension::DOC

to support comment text

=item * HTML::Template::Extension::SLASH_VAR

to support <TMPL_VAR>....</TMPL_VAR> syntax

=item * HTML::Template::Extension::CSTART

to select what parts of your template must be returned by "output" and "html"
method

=item * HTML::Template::Extension::HEAD_BODY

that don't add tag syntax but some method for easily working with html files

=item * HTML::Template::Extension::IF_TERN

that add syntax for ternary if operator %bool_var?if_is_true:if_is_false%

=item * HTML::Template::Extension::DO_NOTHING

that do nothing :-)

=back

For more information about this plugins see relative pods file.

=head1 METHODS

For method also present in the SUPER class there are only described differens.
for a complete description of this methods take a look to SUPER class
HTML::Template.

=head2 output( 'as' => \%params)

Return text present in filename file using %params hash to set TMPL_*
parameters present in this template

=head2 html(\%params,$filename)

Under costruction

=head2 filename($filepath)

Undef costruction

=head2 scalarref(\$text)

Undef costruction

=head2 arrayref(\@lines)

Undef costruction

=head2 filehandle(*FH)

Undef costruction
